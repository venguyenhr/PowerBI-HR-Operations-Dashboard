# HR Operations Dashboard

Power BI Dashboard Project: HR Operations Dashboard

📊 Business Case: The HR management team requires an interactive dashboard to effectively track key HR operations metrics such as headcount, attrition, performance, and engagement. These insights will help monitor workforce health, optimize team performance, and improve employee experience.

🔹 Dashboard Structure - The dashboard includes four key pages:

1. Overview: Monitor general workforce health and diversity, including headcount status, and workforce distribution.
2. Attrition: Analyze voluntary and involuntary attrition by department over the years and explore correlations with tenure and age.
3. Performance: Assess average performance scores, identify the highest and lowest performing departments, and review the score distribution.
4. Engagement & Satisfaction: Measure average engagement and satisfaction scores, highlight the top-performing departments for each, and examine the correlation between these two metrics.

✨ Key Insights & Recommendations:
❶ Overall Workforce
•	The company employs over 300 employees, with most tenured between 5–10 years.
•	The Production department is the largest, indicating the organization is likely in the manufacturing sector, while the Executive Office has only one employee.
👉 Recommendation:
Maintain robust succession planning and recruitment pipelines, particularly for large departments like Production, to ensure business continuity. A contingency staffing plan should also be considered for peak seasons or sudden surges in demand.


❷ Attrition
•	The overall attrition rate remains stable year-over-year at approximately 5%.
•	Most attrition occurs in the Production department, especially among employees with ~7.5 years of tenure.
👉 Recommendation:
While higher attrition in Production may be typical, exit interviews should focus on understanding why long-tenured employees are leaving. This feedback can guide targeted engagement and career development programs to improve retention and support future workforce planning.


❸ Performance
•	The average performance score is nearly 3 out of 4, with most employees rated as "Fully Meets Expectations".
•	The Engineering department has the highest average score (3.09), while Sales has the lowest.
•	Notably, the Engineering team has the widest spread in performance ratings.
👉 Recommendation:
For the Sales department, review KPIs, training programs, and coaching efforts to address low performance. Consider implementing engagement initiatives and exploring root causes of the performance gap.
In parallel, recognize and share best practices from Engineering across other departments. Dig deeper into the Sales team’s distribution, as “Needs Improvement” and “Exceeds Expectations” ratings are more prevalent here than in other teams.


❹ Engagement & Satisfaction
•	The average engagement score is 4.11 (highest in the Executive Office).
•	The average satisfaction score is 3.89 (highest in Engineering).
•	A positive correlation exists between engagement and satisfaction – higher engagement leads to higher satisfaction.
👉 Recommendation:
Continuously analyze what drives high scores in departments like the Executive Office and Engineering to replicate success across others.
Interestingly, the Executive Office has the highest engagement but the lowest satisfaction, which warrants further investigation to uncover underlying causes.


📌 This dashboard serves as a powerful tool for HR teams to make informed, data-driven decisions aimed at improving people operations and workforce health.
